# TeamSeaBunny - RPG Experimental Combat System (ATB)
 This is an experimental project of a ATB-based combat system for our upcoming RPG game (for testing purposes)

The project is based from a Unity tutorial series from YouTube titled "Unity 5 Tutorial: Turn Based Battle System/Combat" by xOctoManx.
